  abstract = {Endoreversible thermodynamics are used for studying the performance of Carnot engines with heat leak. This is done by adding a heat leak term into a variation of the model suggested by DeVos [1]. Heat transfer across the engine is assumed to occur via a conduction/convection mechanism and Newton's law of cooling is employed to model the heat transfer processes. The efficiency at maximum power output is found to be deeply affected by the rate of heat leak. Moreover, the Curzon-Ahlborn relation [2] is shown to represent a special case of the new formulation. Since the suggested model allows more flexibility in predicting actual engines' performance, its use is recommended in thermodynamics courses.},

In particular, a novel (ostensibly all‐adiabatic) engine using two ideal gases of mutually differing atomicities as working substance is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Emphasis is placed on the crucial role of the second law of thermodynamics in a determination of heat‐engine operation.},

The answers to such basic questions represent an emerging class of fundamental optima (extrema) that are redefining thermal science. The combined heat transfer and thermodynamics models and analyses are extremely simple and brief. The method is illustrated by means of six examples: maximum rate of ice production, optimal on \& off operation of defrosting refrigerators and power plants with heat exchangers that experience fouling, optimal allocation of heat exchanger equipment in power plants and refrigeration plants, and optimal spacing between elements in a fixed volume with natural or forced convection.},

  abstract = {The teaching of power cycles in courses of thermodynamics or thermal engineering was traditionally based on first-law analysis. Second-law analysis was typically taught later, and not integrated with it. This approach leaves the student ignorant of the effect of operating parameters and cycle modifications on the accompanying exergy (availability) magnitudes and component irreversibilities, which are necessary for evaluating the potential for further system improvements. It also leaves many of the students with an ambiguous understanding of the exergy concept and its use. Consonant with the gradual changes in this educational approach, which increasingly attempt to integrate first- and second-law analysis, this paper recommends a strategy which integrates exergy analysis into the introduction and teaching of energy systems, demonstrated and made didactically appealing by an examination of the historical evolution of power plants, emphasizing the objectives for improvements, accomplishments, constraints, and consequently the remaining opportunities. Important conclusions from exergy analysis, not obtainable from the conventional energy analysis, were emphasized. It was found that this approach evoked the intellectual curiosity of students and increased their interest in the course.},

This is then clarified, refined and made quantitative by the addition of the quality of heat, the temperature. The student will be familiar with the idea that temperature differences drive heat flows. The new concept is that the individual temperatures are significant, not just their difference. A high temperature drives a heat flow to a low temperature and in so doing can provide something useful, like work. We pollute our environment if we dissipate this opportunity. This approach leads naturally to the Second Law, to Carnot efficiency and the Kelvin scale.},

  abstract = {This study is aimed at theoretical analysis of the effects of the geometrical parameters on the shaft work of the Stirling engines. The optimal combination of the phase angle and the swept volume ratio, that leads to maximization of the shaft work of the engine, is obtained under different specified conditions. Effects of the effectiveness of mechanism, the dead volume ratio, and the temperature ratio on the maximum shaft work of the engine as well as the optimal combination of the phase angle and the swept volume ration are evaluated. Theoretical analysis of the performance of three types of Stirling engines, α-, β-, and γ-type, has also been carried out, and a comparison in relative performance among these three types of engines is attempted. Results show that for the particular cases considered in this study, the β-type Stirling engine produces highest shaft work and the γ-type engine the lowest. In general, the γ-type engine must be very mechanism effective so as to deliver sufficient shaft work. However, among the three types of engines, the γ-type engine is most capable of operating with low temperature difference. On the contrary, the α-type engine is particularly not suitable for the applications with low temperature difference since its dimensionless shaft work is found to gradually vanish as the temperature ratio is increased.},
