\section{Conclusions}

    This     work     has     illustrated     the     validity     of      Carnot's      general
    proposition~\cite{1897-ThurstonRH-Wiley} by using a parametric, reversible  Stirling  engine
    model from the literature~\cite{2012-ChengCH+YangHS-ApEnergy} that takes into account engine
    geometry and working fluid properties. Moreover, the analytic nature of the model, with  its
    exact solution, helps in keeping the illustration concise and exact, and generic up  to  the
    model's modeling space.

    In one hand, the example illustrated herein is less generic and less conceptual (i.e.,  more
    instantiated) than the canonical proof by contradiction using only general concepts, usually
    presented  in   thermodynamics   courses   and   textbooks~\cite{2013-CengelYA+BolesMA-AMGH,
    2002-MoranMJ+ShapiroHN-LTC, 1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley}, and therefore, evidently does not
    serve as a general replacement of the proof by contradiction.

    On the other hand, the illustration based on a reversible model of a \emph{real}  engine  is
    more defined and hopefully more palpable and interesting  to  inquiring  students.  One  can
    argue that at least the illustration complements the proof by contradiction  and  may  boost
    interest by the more concrete approach.
