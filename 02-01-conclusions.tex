\section{Conclusions}

    This   work   has   proposed    illustrating    the    validity    of    Carnot's    general
    proposition~\cite{1897-ThurstonRH-Wiley} by using a parametric, reversible  Stirling  engine
    model from the literature~\cite{2012-ChengCH+YangHS-ApEnergy} that takes into account engine
    geometry and working fluid properties. Moreover, the analytic nature of the model, with  its
    exact solution, helps in keeping the illustration concise and exact, and generic up  to  the
    model's modeling space.

    In one hand, the example illustrated herein is less generic and  less  conceptual  than  the
    canonical proof by contradition using only concepts,  usually  presented  in  thermodynamics
    courses    and    textboks~\cite{2013-CengelYA+BolesMA-AMGH,     2002-MoranMJ+ShapiroHN-LTC,
    1986-JonesJB+HawkinsGA-Wiley},  and  therefore,  evidently  does  not  serve  as  a  general
    replacement of the proof by contradiction.

    On the other hand, the illustration based on a reversible model of a \emph{real}  engine  is
    less conceptual and hopefully more palpable and interesting to students. One can argue  that
    at least the illustration complements the proof by contradiction and may boost  interest  by
    the more concrete approach.
